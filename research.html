							<p>I love running and exploring simulations of galaxies and gas evolution in the universe. This has led me to many interesting science questions throughout my career. I have explored the dynamics of the Magellanic Clouds and the formation of the gaseous Magellanic Stream. This led to the prediction that the Large Magellanic Cloud must have been embedded within a warm, ionized circumgalactic medium (CGM) before it approached the Milky Way. This additional component is able to explain the very high ionization fractions observed all throughout the Magellanic Stream.<br/><br/>
							I am also interested in the composition of galaxies' circumgalactic medium more generally. Do satellite galaxies provide the cold gas we see in the CGM? Or is its multiphase nature naturally produced through local instabilities or galactic outflows? I have been exploring the origin and fate of cold clouds in the CGM that are analogus to the observed "high-velocity" clouds (HVCs) around the Milky Way. In the Illustris TNG simulations, it seems that most of the HVC analogs are formed through thermal instability.<br/><br/>
							These topics also mesh very well with galactic dynamics. I have explored the impact of the Galactic bar on the motions of stars in the solar neighborhood. As well as the impact of various simulation techniques on the orbital motions of satellite galaxies.<br/><br/>
							In the past, I have completed projects on characterizing light curves of "ultra-long period" Cepheid variable stars, detecting and analyzing the evolution of canopy regions on the Sun using AIA images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and constraining theoretical mechanisms of jet formation in proto-planetary nebulae. I also received a Master's degree in Theoretical Physics from the University of Edinburgh in 2017 where I performed calculations in self-dual Yang-Mills theory to learn more about the connection between quantum field theory and quantum gravity using the double copy.</p>

								The bulk of my work over the past few years has been in running N-body hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of the Magellanic Stream. These simulations have shown that a warm circumgalactic medium around the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC), the Magellanic Corona, is a key ingredient in being able to account for the high ionization fraction and total mass of the Stream. Previous works had not been able to explain the massive amount of ionized gas (~2 billion solar masses) which makes up the majority of the Stream's mass budget. Since the Magellanic Corona is expected to be around the virial temperature of the LMC (3&times;10<sup>5</sup> K for an LMC halo of 2&times;10<sup>11</sup> solar masses), this gas should be ionized. Therefore, as the Magellanic Clouds fall in towards the Milky Way, the Magellanic Corona is warped and stretched by the Milky Way's gravitational potential and its own hot circumgalactic gas. This work was published in September 2020 in Nature:<br>

								Upon the inclusion of the Magellanic Corona, the interaction history of the Magellanic Clouds will be changed. The Magellanic Corona not only provides additional gravitational potential, but the hydrodynamical friction and ram-pressure forces also cause the SMC's orbit around the LMC to decay more quickly. My second paper presented improved models in which the present-day positions and velocities of the Magellanic Clouds match their observed values within 3 sigma. Exploring the parameter space of possible orbits through analytical integration, we selected 10 and ran them in full hydrodynamical simulations using GIZMO. 7 out of the 10 formed Streams all with similar properties. The interaction history that best matched the present-day velocities of the Clouds includes two interactions over 3.4 billion years tidally producing a Trailing Stream and gaseous Bridge. The most interesting result is that in all 7 simulated Streams, the stripped gas ends up very close to the Sun, as close as 20 kiloparsecs away, which is a significant paradigm shift from previous models which predicted distances out to 100-200 kiloparsecs away.

								In the third paper in this series, we explored the parameter space of properties for the Magellanic Corona. By running a suite of simulations varying the Corona's initial mass and temperature, we determined that the LMC can host a stable CGM for &gt;4 Gyr with masses &gt;2&times;10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>&odot;</sub>. Through tidal interactions between the Magellanic Clouds (while embedded within the Corona), the Magellanic Stream is formed and our simulations of the full three-body interactions (including the Milky Way) can reproduce the observed total mass of the neutral and ionized components of the Trailing Stream, size of the LMC disk, ionization fractions along the Stream, morphology of the neutral gas, and on-sky extent of the ionized gas.

								I have also been working with two undergraduates at UW - Madison on the detection and characterization of stellar moving groups in the Milky Way. We have developed a new, open-source Wavelet Transformtion code, MGwave (soon to be available on GitHub) to analyze <em>Gaia</em> data. Selecting stars near the Sun, we use MWwave to identify substructures in velocity space. The figure shows the histogram of stars in azimuthal velocity vs radial velocity space (in Galactocentric coordinates), and its corresponding wavelet transformed image in which purple (green) regions denote over (under) densities and the red (blue) crosses show the locations of the maxima (minima). Using the third data release from <em>Gaia</em>, we detected three new moving groups (circled) and three additional groups previously not seen in <em>Gaia</em> data (squares).

								With the third data release from <em>Gaia</em>, we now have over 30 million stars with full 3D position and 3D velocity data. This allows us to explore the kinematic structure of the Milky Way throughout the disk. In the image, we're showing the locations of the maxima in the wavelet image as we progress through Galactocentric radius. The points are colored by their radius value and you can see that many of the structures that we see in the solar neighborhood (shown as squares) are connected throughout the rest of the disk. This indicates that these moving groups are large-scale structures likely formed through gravitational effects instead of local, transient features. The properties of these extended moving groups can then tell us about the gravitational potential and non-axisymmetric features of the Milky Way.

								We have used this technique to specifically track the Hercules moving group in azimuth around the Galactic disk. the <em>Gaia</em> DR3 data allowed us to extend this search to &pm;15&deg; from the solar position. Simulations have previously shown that if Hercules is formed through trapping of stars due to the Galactic bar's corotation resonance, we would expect the azimuthal velocity and strength of the moving group to increase as we approach the minor axis of the bar (+&phi;). This is because the Hercules stars are trapped orbiting around the L4/L5 Lagrange points of the Milky Way's bar. We would not see this behavior in the velocity and strength of Hercules if it were formed through the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar. These two theories of the formation of Hercules are tied to different regimes of pattern speed for the bar. For a slowly rotating bar (pattern speed &sim;40 km/s/kpc), the corotation radius falls near the solar position and thus could be the mechanism for Hercules formation. While for a high pattern speed bar (&sim;55 km/s/kpc), the radius of the outer Lindblad resonance falls near Hercules. We find the velocity and strength of Hercules change exactly as expected for a low pattern speed bar, thus independently confirming other measurements of the Milky Way's bar.
